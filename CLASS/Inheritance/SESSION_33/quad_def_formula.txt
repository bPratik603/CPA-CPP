1) Perimeter -> Sum of all sides of quadrilateral is a perimeter 

2) Area-> 
if a, b, c, d are sides of quadrilateral: 

s = (a + b + c + d)/2   (also known as semi-perimeter)

sqrt of ((s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c) * (s-d)) (Horn's formula)

3) Validity check: 
    lengths of all sides of square must be positive 
    sum of any three sides of quadrilateral is greater than third fourth one
