// Under C lang, if a function has structure instance or structure pointer 
// then C compiler CANNOT prevent access to internal members of structure 
// within that function (if function uses dot or arrow operator)
// BECAUSE function owns that object (owns = memory allocation)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------


// blanket ban on all functions to access the internal members of a structure 
// will not work because then NOBODY will be able to access structure instances 
// and such data will be USELESS. 

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// SOME FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE WRITTEN TO ACCESS STRUCTURE INSTANCE KNOWING THEIR 
// INTERNAL LAYOUT 

// REST OF THE FUNCTIONS WHO WANT TO PROCESS STRUCTURE INSTANCE SHOULD DO SO 
// BY CALLING SUCH FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE PRIVY TO INTERNAL DATA LAYOUT OF STRUCTURE
