Coding plan: 

date.h  date_server.c --> // server side (Company machine)

date.h + date_server -> BUILD -> date.dll 


WRAPS(date.dll + date.h)

and gives to a client 



date_client.c --> // Client machine (at his home )

client will include header date.h without which 
struct date declaration cannot be found. 

Client will UNWRAP (date.h + date.dll)

// DEPLOYMENT AT CLIENT's END 
date.h -> include 
date.dll -> system32 

// CLIENT WILL INCLUDE date.h and LINK date.dll 

// if server changes struct date then server should 
// also change create_date to destroy_date definitions 

// prepare new date.h and new date.dll 

// client SIMPLY needs to replace 
old date.h-> new date.h 

and 

old date.dll by new date.dll
